# Tikibase

_timeless wiki-like knowledge database_

Tikibase is an extremely robust knowledge base that will be usable for decades.

- semi-structured data to answer complex questions
- links and backlinks
- storage format is human and machine editable Markdown organized in files
- history is stored in Git
- simple CLI tools and bots to automate maintenance

### Why

Over the last couple of decades, I have used many types of software to store
things that I want to remember:

- various outliners on Windows, MacOS, and the web
- Evernote
- Simplenote
- Apple Notes
- Dynalist
- Notational Velocity
- custom-built web and desktop applications

All of them have been limited and/or became unsupported at some point.

- no backlinks
- no structure

### Development

- run a single unit test: `go test ./storage/foo_test.go`
